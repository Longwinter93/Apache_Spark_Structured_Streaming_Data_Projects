# Spark_Structured_Streaming_Data_Projects
<br />There is only one project is related to **Spark Structured Streaming**.
<br />**Structured Streaming** is a scalable and fault-tolerant stream processing engine built on the Spark SQL engine. 
<br />**Spark Streaming** is a processing engine to process data in real-time from sources and output data to external storage systems.

## [SparkStructuredStreaming_Project1](https://github.com/Longwinter93/Streaming_Data_Projects/tree/main/SparkStructuredStreaming_Project1)

<br />CSV files was read as files written in a directory as a stream of data. 
<br />_Input source_ is treated as file source.
<br />The final result of streaming data was saved in a Streaming DataFrame. 
<br />Streaming DataFrame was aggregated and not aggregated.
<br />Streaming DataFrame was saved as JSON and parquet files. 
<br />_Output sinks_ are treated as parquet and json files. 
<br />Our _file sink_ stores the output to parquet as well as json files.
<br />_Spark Streaming Engine_ proccesses these steps.
